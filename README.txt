This is a project about a group playing scrabble and the code organizes the players, words, and points.

The first part of the project maps letters to points and there is a function to calculate how many points a word is worth and then a dictionary with each player's words is initialized.

In the second part of the project a function was created to calculate how many points a player currently has and this values are stored in the dictionary player_to_points.Then another function is created to add a new word to a player's words and calculate the new value of his or her points.

Finally, the last function is tested and the dictionaries with each player's words and points are printed.
